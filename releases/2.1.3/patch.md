# Developer Notes.
- Happy Holidays, I'm currently recovering from my ankle surgery (Broken Ankle), a bit more inactive than usual, will be gone in January to have a follow up surgery, so things are going to be a bit slower in January as well. Sorry, Version 3.0 will come out later than planned due to these things, which will include EOW & BOTW Ultracam and bunch of other cool things to look out for, they are currently in [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/MaxLastBreath)/[Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/maxlastbreath) testing phase.

# TOTK Optimizer Changes 
- Removed one dir as a download option, it was causing a lot of issues lately.

# Bug Fixes
- Fixed instances where the game would crash randomly and unexplainably, this should hopefully fix some crash issues you guys had in the past.
- Fixed frame inconsistencies at 60 FPS lock.
