## Developer Update : 
About a month ago, I broke my Ankle had to go over a pretty complex surgery and was hospitalized for a while, I know some of you don't follow my [Discord](https://discord.gg/the-way-of-the-wind-1111435904687550587) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/MaxLastBreath)/[Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/maxlastbreath), Version 3.0 of the Optimizer, soon to be named (NX Optimizer) is being developed, currently delayed due to the current circumstances, Version 3.0 is a complete code rewrite and has a few new games supported that were modded by me (Echoes of wisdom, Breath of the Wild and Pokemon Scarlet/Violet), there's a branch that is open with a nighty build you can find [here](https://github.com/MaxLastBreath/TOTK-mods/tree/Universal-Optimizer), the action tab has a few builds that are downloadable (Requires a git account), but only TOTK and the Pokemon Mods can be installed currently, Version 3.0 will be completely offline, with only auto-update check from Git.

## TOTK Optimizer 2.1.1
This update brings in a few changes that have been long awaited, fixing the climbing speed issues and ladder climbing issues, those fixes have been available in the beta for some time, I didn't have the time to port them backwards due to my Surgery and other circumstances, it's very painful for me to sit in-front of the PC at the moment, which makes it harder to work on things.
