# NX Optimizer 3.0

This update is a significant refactor with nearly every system rewritten. **6000+** lines of code changed, **180+** files updated. This update has been in the works for over 5 months and the game updates have been in the works for over a year.
- This entire project is ran by me, MaxLastBreath, it's very difficult to release updates often on this scale, so delay on Updates is expected. Mods of this scale are tremendous amount of work.

### The Update Aims to
- Compatibility for more than just Tears Of The Kingdom (new games)
- Website for streamlined mod game information
- Rebranding TOTK Optimizer to NX Optimizer
- Improve the entire backend, basically the entire project has been rewritten.
